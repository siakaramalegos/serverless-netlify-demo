# Serverless Functions + Netlify Demo and Tutorial

This is the repo used in my workshop on Serverless Functions using Netlify.

To use it, first fork it! You will need a clean remote from your Github account for Netlify to be able to access it. Then clone your version of this repo, and run `npm install`.

Each step is organized into separate branches. The `main` branch contains the starting point code, and major steps in the workshop are each in a separate branch. The final code is in the `latest` branch which is also deployed to [astrobirthday.netlify.app/](https://astrobirthday.netlify.app/).
